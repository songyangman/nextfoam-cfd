tar zxf openmpi-4.0.5.tar.gz
rm openmpi-4.0.5.tar.gz
cd openmpi-4.0.5
./configure --prefix=/opt/openmpi-4.0.5
make -j 4 all
make install
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/opt/openmpi-4.0.5/bin' >> /etc/bash.bashrc
```
Clone `nextfoam-cfd` and move to the top directory

```
mkdir -p /opt/OpenFOAM
git clone https://github.com/nextfoam/nextfoam-cfd.git
mv nextfoam-cfd/NextFOAM-2407 /opt/OpenFOAM
mv nextfoam-cfd/ThirdParty-2407 /opt/OpenFOAM
```

Setup the environment variables in the `/opt/OpenFOAM/NextFOAM-2407/etc/bashrc`
```
vi /opt/OpenFOAM/NextFOAM-2407/etc/bashrc

export WM_PROJECT_VERSION=2407
projectDir="/opt/OpenFOAM/NextFOAM-$WM_PROJECT_VERSION"
```

Compile NextFOAM-2407.

**(Note)** If you install NextFOAM-2407 on Ubuntu 22.04, you should install `gcc-9` and `g++-9` and set `gcc-9` as the compiler. 

```
apt install gcc-9 g++-9
export WM_COMPILE_CONTROL="version=9"
echo 'export WM_COMPILE_CONTROL="version=9"' >> /etc/bash.bashrc
```

```
source /opt/OpenFOAM/NextFOAM-2407/etc/bashrc
cd /opt/OpenFOAM/NextFOAM-2407
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$WM_THIRD_PARTY_DIR/platforms/linux64Gcc/fftw-3.3.10/lib
./Allwmake -j
```

Enable the environment variables at start time
```
echo 'source /opt/OpenFOAM/NextFOAM-2407/etc/bashrc' >> /etc/bash.bashrc
```
